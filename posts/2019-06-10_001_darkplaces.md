# Darkplaces

There exists an advanced game engine for Quake 1 that gives it better graphics.

The one thing it does not give is an ability to Alt+Tab on Linux. So if you want to do something while playing, you have to stop the game, save it and then exit.

Xonotic that uses darkplaces engine somehow fixed the problem. But unfortunately, it was not backported to the original.
